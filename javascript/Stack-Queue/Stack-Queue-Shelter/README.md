# Stacks and Queues

In stacks we deal with the top node only, in queue we use enqueue and dequeue which works from the front only

## Challenge

Need to make a class to enqueue a node and dequeue a cat or dog and return null or the object we asked for



## API

enqueue : adds an element into the queue

dequeue : removes an element from the queue
